# [MAIA Mobile AI Assistant](https://github.com/ovidiurosu90/maia-mobile-ai-assistant)

## Abstract
### Problem
Interact with people in an unknown environment, and execute simple actions autonomously

### Solution
Mobile AI Assistant that is able to receive voice commands from people, navigate autonomously, and execute simple actions leveraging AI

### How
- the whole project is open-source, and can be replicated by interested parties (note it requires a variety of skills like setting up a web server, conding, 3d printing, soldering & crimping)
- this robot will be mounted on the [3R2 ROS Real Robot v2](https://github.com/ovidiurosu90/3r2-ros-real-robot-v2), in order to navigate autonomously

### Notes
- the project is in early stages, and everything will change along the way (requirements, design, components, etc.)
- at the moment there is no clear end-solution, so a lot of its core capabilities are still to be researched

## Robot potential capabilities
- monitor people and take actions based on their sentiments (e.g. say a joke if I'm sad, or tell me when my girlfriend is upset)
- meet and greet at the door, or in any room of the apartment
- simple voice interaction (e.g. answering what's the temperature outside)
- follow a person inside an apartment and take notes (e.g. for shopping list, or documenting training exercises)
